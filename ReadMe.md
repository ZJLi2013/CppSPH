This is a sph solver derived from SPHysics, but implemented by Cpp.

The reason of this project is focusing on computation efficiency, basically including two things:

1 space dividing algorithm with link list
2 limit check algorithm

Others will be similar as SPHFEM, but with more implements on  Sympletic time-stepping scheme, Dynamic B.C., Periodic B.C., Moving Objects<both pre-imposed and fluid driven)

There are three classes: Particle, Object, SphSystem
